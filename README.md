# Fly Dream Air
FlyDreamAir is a major airline which covers both international and domestic routes with a large fleet of aircrafts. The airline has a large network of travel agencies and customers across the world. FlyDream is planning to digitalize its business processes and operations, and has identified three potential projects:   

• Project 1: develop an IT software system to manage customers and allow them to book flights, manage flight reservations, seat selections, purchasing in-flight services such as food and drinks.   
• Project 2: develop an IT software system to manage loyalty programs (e.g., frequent flyer points and rewards including a wide range of ways to earn points, use points, status upgrade, etc.).    
• Project 3: develop an IT software system to manage the airline’s lounges across the world (e.g., customer membership, pay-per-use, bookings, cancellations, occupancy management, search for lounges, etc.)  

Assume that you are members of FlyDreamAir IT team. You are required to select and execute one of the above projects. In doing so, you would need to exercise various project management skills in different project management knowledge areas that are discussed in this subject. Note that the focus is on the project management aspect, rather than the software itself (see the Guidelines section above for more details).
